);

# 2. Create Review table, with foreign key=video_id with constraint,

create table tblreviews (
  review_id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
, user_name varchar(50) NOT NULL
, rating int NULL
, review_text varchar(255) NOT NULL
, create_datetime datetime NOT NULL
, video_id int NOT NULL
, check (rating between 0 and 5)
, primary key (review_id)
, foreign key fk_videos (video_id)
  references tblvideos (video_id)
  ON UPDATE NO ACTION
  ON DELETE CASCADE
